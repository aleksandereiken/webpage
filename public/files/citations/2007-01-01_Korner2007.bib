  abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to measure the circulating levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon in patients who had undergone adjustable gastric banding (BND) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to understand the differences in glucose and insulin regulation after these procedures. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 3 groups of women matched for age and body mass index: group 1, overweight controls (n = 13); group 2, BND (n = 10); and group 3, RYGB (n = 13). Venous blood was drawn with the patient in the fasted state and throughout a 3-hour period after a liquid meal. Results: The fasting glucose level was similar between the 2 surgery groups; however, the fasting insulin concentrations were greater in the BND (10.0 ??U/mL) than in the RYGB (6.2 ??U/mL; P {\textless}0.05) group. The glucose level at 60 minutes was significantly lower in the RYGB group (70 mg/dL, range 38-82) than in the BND group (83 mg/dL, range 63-98). The GLP-1 levels at 30 minutes were more than threefold greater in the RYGB group (96 pmol/L) compared with the BND and overweight control (28 pmol/L) groups. The GLP-1 and insulin concentrations correlated at 30 minutes only in the RYGB group (r = .66; P = .013). The glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide levels at 30 minutes were lower in the RYGB group (20 pmol/L) than in the BND group (31 pmol/L) or overweight control group (33 pmol/L). The peak glucagon levels were similar among the 3 groups. Conclusion: Exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 and blunted glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide secretion after RYGB might contribute to the greater weight loss and improved glucose homeostasis compared with BND. ?? 2007 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.},
