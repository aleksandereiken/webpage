  abstract = {Rapid Response: Re: The rise and rise of vitamin D testing Bilinski and Boyages recently reported that guidelines are needed to limit overtesting, overdiagnosis and overtreatment (1) of vitamin D disorders. Similar concerns exist for interlaboratory variability (2) and choosing the gold standard (3) for testing vitamin D. A recent clinical guideline recommends that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) is measured by “a reliable assay” (4) and defines vitamin D insufficiency as 25-OHD of 52.5-72.5 nmol/L (21-29 ng/mL)(4) and vitamin D deficiency as values below 50 nmol/L (below 20 ng/mL)(4). Our data from an osteoporosis study among postmenopausal women who have all been taking 5600 IU of vitamin D weekly for more than two years suggest that a widespread overtreatment could exist depending on the method used. All 41 women had 25-OHD measured both at our own laboratory using Siemens ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay (we are making 60.000 vitamin D analyses per year) and by LC/MS/MS Quest diagnostic at Nichols Institute, CA, USA (Figure below). Siemens ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay measured vitamin D values below the LC/MS/MS technology (p{\textless}0.01), on average 21.4{\%}. None of the women measured by LC/MS/MS had vitamin D deficiency versus 12 {\%} measured by Siemens ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay. Among women with vitamin D levels above 72.5 nmol/L as detected by LC/MS/MS technology, 54 {\%} had 25-OHD levels below 72.5 nmol/L according to our Siemens ADVIA Centaur Vitamin D Total assay. This means that these women would have been overtreated with vitamin D if the diagnosis of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency had been based on our laboratory results. In fully automated assays not all 25-OHD is extracted from the D vitamin Binding Protein (DBP) in sera with a relatively high DBP concentration (5). Such incomplete extraction leads to falsely low 25-OHD concentration results (5) which may have been the case in our laboratory. Guidelines are urgently needed for reliable assays for vitamin D.},
