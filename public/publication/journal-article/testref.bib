abstract = {BACKGROUND The inflammatory markers YKL-40 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are elevated in morbidly obese patients and decline after weight loss. The objective of our study was to investigate the possible changes of YKL-40 and MCP-1, in both the fasting and the postprandial states, following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). METHODS Ten obese patients with T2D and 10 subjects with NGT were examined in the fasting state and after a standard meal prior to and after (1 week, 3 months, and 1 year) RYGB. RESULTS Fasting state MCP-1 levels decreased after RYGB in both groups (P values {\textless} 0.0001) whereas fasting YKL-40 levels were unchanged (P values ≥ 0.120). Postprandial MCP-1 levels showed a tendency towards a decrease on most study days; however, the changes were only significant at 1 week (P = 0.001) and 1 yr (P {\textless} 0.0001) in the T2D group and at 3 mo after RYGB in the NGT group (P = 0.009). YKL-40 levels showed a slight, postprandial suppression on all study days in the T2D group (all P values ≤ 0.021). CONCLUSIONS Fasting MCP-1 levels, but not YKL-40 levels, decrease after RYGB in subjects with T2D and NGT. Postprandial changes of inflammatory markers are discrete and inconsistent.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to measure the circulating levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), and glucagon in patients who had undergone adjustable gastric banding (BND) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) to understand the differences in glucose and insulin regulation after these procedures. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 3 groups of women matched for age and body mass index: group 1, overweight controls (n = 13); group 2, BND (n = 10); and group 3, RYGB (n = 13). Venous blood was drawn with the patient in the fasted state and throughout a 3-hour period after a liquid meal. Results: The fasting glucose level was similar between the 2 surgery groups; however, the fasting insulin concentrations were greater in the BND (10.0 ??U/mL) than in the RYGB (6.2 ??U/mL; P {\textless}0.05) group. The glucose level at 60 minutes was significantly lower in the RYGB group (70 mg/dL, range 38-82) than in the BND group (83 mg/dL, range 63-98). The GLP-1 levels at 30 minutes were more than threefold greater in the RYGB group (96 pmol/L) compared with the BND and overweight control (28 pmol/L) groups. The GLP-1 and insulin concentrations correlated at 30 minutes only in the RYGB group (r = .66; P = .013). The glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide levels at 30 minutes were lower in the RYGB group (20 pmol/L) than in the BND group (31 pmol/L) or overweight control group (33 pmol/L). The peak glucagon levels were similar among the 3 groups. Conclusion: Exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 and blunted glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide secretion after RYGB might contribute to the greater weight loss and improved glucose homeostasis compared with BND. ?? 2007 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.},

abstract = {Mice, rats, and pigs are the three most used animal models when studying gastrointestinal peptide hormones; however their distribution from the duodenum to the distal colon has not been characterized systematically across mice, rats and pigs. We therefore performed a comparative distribution analysis of the tissue content of the major appetite- and glucose regulatory peptides: glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-2), oxyntomodulin/glicentin, neurotensin, and peptide YY (PYY) from the duodenum to distal colon in mice (n = 9), rats (n = 9) and pigs (n = 8), using validated radioimmunoassays. GLP-1, GLP-2 and oxyntomodulin/glicentin show similar patterns of distribution within the respective species, but for rats and pigs the highest levels were found in the distal small intestine, whereas for the mouse the highest level was found in the distal colon. In rats and pigs, neurotensin was predominantly detected in mid and lower part of the small intestine, while the mouse showed the highest levels in the distal small intestine. In contrast, the distribution of GIP was restricted to the proximal small intestine in all three species. Most surprisingly, in the pig PYY was found in large amounts in the proximal part of the small intestine whereas both rats and mice had undetectable levels until the distal small intestine. In summary, the distribution patterns of extractable GIP, GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin/glicentin, neurotensin are preserved across species whereas PYY distribution showed marked differences.},
